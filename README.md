Loan Eligibility Prediction
Overview
This project builds a machine learning solution to predict whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan, based on various financial and personal details such as income, loan amount, and credit history. By automating the decision-making process, it aims to help financial institutions make faster, fairer, and more consistent loan approval decisions.

Problem Statement
A finance company wants to automate its loan eligibility process to reduce manual workload and improve decision accuracy. The goal is to develop a predictive model that determines loan approval based on applicant information.

Approach
A complete end-to-end data science pipeline was implemented, covering:

Hypothesis Generation based on domain insights

Data Understanding and inspection

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – handling missing values & outliers

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) –

Univariate Analysis

Bivariate Analysis to uncover relationships

Feature Engineering – creating meaningful new variables

Model Training & Evaluation using multiple algorithms

Comparison of Models to select the best performer

Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Outcome
✅ Achieved 80% accuracy in predicting loan eligibility using Logistic Regression with Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation.
